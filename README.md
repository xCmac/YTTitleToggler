# YT Toggler

Chrome extension (Content Script)
runs on Youtube.
Injects some javascript so that you can hide/show the title div.


I created this because sometimes I don't want people to know what I'm watching, be it at work, public, wherever. Sometimes Youtube videos have irrelevant(obscene) titles that might make others think WTF even though the video itsself is not obscene.
